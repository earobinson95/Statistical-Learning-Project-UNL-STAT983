# Reports

### Project Proposal

+ Due on Canvas at **11:59pm, Monday, March, 22, 2021**

Needed in Project Proposal (1-3 Pages)

+ Project Description
+ How and where we obtained our data (Maybe a quick description of it as well? Link to Kaggle)
+ Scientific Research Questions you may want to address and corresponding machine learning and statistical learning methods

See project proposal [here](https://earobinson95.github.io/Statistical-Learning-Project-UNL-STAT983/reports/proposal.pdf)

### Final Presentation

+ Due on Canvas at **5:00pm, Sunday, April 25, 2021**

+ Presentation slide (either pptx or pdf version will be fine) and recorded oral presentation video.

+ There are no specific guidelines on the presentations, and the common sense applies, e.g., write all team members' names somewhere on the first slide, highlight your problem, data set, main ideas/methods, and conclusions. Ideally you or your team should prepare for the slides so that each teammate member can present about 3.5 minutes, e.g., a team of 2 students will prepare for slides for 7-minutes presentation, and a team of 3 students should prepare for slides for 13-minutes presentation, etc.

### Final Report

+ Due on Canvas at **5:00pm, Wednesday April 28, 2021.**

Needed in Final Report (No longer than 25 pages, main body typically between 5 and 12 pages).

+ Clear explanations of models chosen, hypotheses tested, and findings analogous to what you would produce for a consulting project.
+ What is the work? Why is it important? What background is needed? How will the work be presented?
+ Important: For the purpose of this class, at the end of conclusion section of your final report, please add a subsection for lessons you learned from this project or this course. You can also write any suggestions to the instructor.

Suggested Format

1. Title Page: Project Title, author(s) (your name and email address), the submission date, course name/number;

2. Abstract: informative summary of the whole report (100-300 words).

3. Introduction includes problem description and motivation, data mining challenge(s), problem solving strategies, accomplished learning from the applications and outline of the report.

4. Problem Statement or Data Sources: cite the data sources, and provide a simple presentation of data to help readers understand the problem or challenge(s).

5. Proposed Methodology: explain (and justify) your proposed data mining strategies.

6. Analysis and Results: present key findings when executing the proposed data mining methods. For the benefit of readability, detailed results should be placed in the Appendix. Reference of computer softwares to implement your proposed data mining methods (even it is a web page) should be given.

7. Conclusions: Draw conclusions from your data mining practice. Unfinished or possible future work could be included (with proper explanation or justification). 
**A Mandatory Subsection of "Lessons we have learned":** at the end of conclusion section, please add a subsection for lessons you or your team learned from this project or this course. Please feel free to write any comments/suggestions/remarks, or share your experiences of data mining.

8. Appendix: This section only includes needed documents to support the presentation in the report. Feel free to divide it into several subsections if necessary. Do NOT dump all computer outputs unorganized here.

9. Bibliography.

Parts 3-6 constitute the main body of the paper for your primary audience. Usually, as with fictional boss in this example, your audience is intelligent but unschooled in Data Mining or Statistics. So these parts should have as little technical material as you can possibly get away with.

It is appropriate, and even recommended, to refer the reader to the appendix in part 8 if you need to provide a more technical explanation for something. Part 8 is your secondary audience - me - and should follow closely enough the "story" of parts 4 - 6 that it is easy for me to see what technical material backs up with results and discussion.

It is not necessary to number these parts 1-9 or name them as-above-mentioned. Please feel free to merge
some parts or provide more informative section names if it seems natural to do so.
