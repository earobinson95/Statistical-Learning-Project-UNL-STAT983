	abstract = {We propose to furnish visual statistical methods with an inferential framework and protocol, modelled on confirmatory statistical testing. In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of ‘discoveries’ is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the ‘lineup’ popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the ‘Rorschach’ inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students’ statistical thinking.},

	abstract = {Whether cognitive representations are better conceived as language-based, symbolic representations or perceptually related, analog representations is a subject of debate. If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens’ law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.},

Therefore, if a continuumbetween perceptual and cognitive processes exists, numerical representations should also be represented on a nonlinear, compressed “number scale.”
To reach equal discriminability for numerosities smaller and larger than the sample numerosity, the numerical distance between sample and test must be larger if the test numerosity is higher than the sample. This effect should become even more obvious for larger magnitudes.

nonlinearly compressed scaling


the idea is that compression enlarges the coding space, thus increasing the dynamic range of perception and firing neurons.

Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P {\textless} 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: r = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.

A random sample of women (N = 266) completed a questionnaire assessing numeracy and risk perception of prenatal test results and results of colon cancer screening tests. The authors examined the relationships between risk level (high v. low) and format of risk presentation (ratio, pictogram, or Paling Perspective Scale) and whether these relationships differed based on the numeracy skills of the participant.

Results. The authors identified a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) 3-way interaction between format, risk level, and numeracy: high-numerate participants in the low-risk group perceived the test results as less risky compared with participants in the high-risk group (P {\textless} 0.001) with the Paling Perspective Scale but not with the other formats. For lownumerate participants, they did not observe differences between low- and high-risk scenarios for any of the 3 formats. The results were similar for the Down syndrome and colon cancer scenarios. Overall, the pictogram resulted in significantly lower risk ratings compared with the Paling Perspective Scale and the ratio with numerator 1 (P {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusion. Different communication formats may produce different risk perceptions, but the effect is qualified by patients’ numeracy skills.

Paling Perspective Scale is a graphical representation that depicts risks covering different orders of magnitude on a logarithmic scale.

The Paling Perspective Scale uses a logarithmic scale to depict comparative risk information. Our previous study indicated that participants did not use the logarithmic scale to rate the risk.15We obtained similar resultswhenwe compared the Paling Perspective Scale with a list providing comparative risk information. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the logarithmic scale is the reason why low-numerate individuals did not differentiate between high- and low-risk levels. In addition, the magnifier scale employing a logarithmic scale23 was found to be used by low-numerate individuals in the same way as by high-numerate individuals. Further research evaluating risk communication formats that provide comparative information as a table is needed to qualify this conclusion.

	abstract = {Background. Quantitative risk information plays an important role in decision making about health. This study focuses on commonly used numerical and graphical formats and examines their effect on perception of different likelihoods and choice preferences. Methods. An experimental study was conducted with 192 participants, who evaluated 2 sets of 4 lotteries. Numerical formats to describe likelihood varied systematically between participants (X\%, X-in-100, or 1-in-X). The effect of  graphic formats (bar charts, icon charts) was assessed as a withinsubjects factor. Dependent measures included perceived likelihood, choice preferences about participating in the lottery, and processing times. Results. Numerical likelihoods presented as 1-in-X were processed fastest and were perceived as conveying larger likelihoods than the X-in-100 and percentages formats (mean response times in seconds: 5.65 v. 7.31 and 6.50; mean rating on a 1–9 scale: 4.38 v. 3.30 and 3.31, respectively). The 1-in-X format also evoked a stronger willingness to participate in a lottery than the 2 other numerical formats. The effect of adding graphs on perceived likelihood was moderated by numerical aptitude. Graphs reduced ratings of perceived likelihood of participants with lower numeracy, while there was no overall effect for participants with higher numeracy. Conclusion. Perception of likelihood differs significantly depending on the numerical format used. The 1-in-X format yields higher perceived likelihoods and it appears to be the easiest format to interpret. Graphs primarily affect perception of likelihood of people with lower numerical aptitude. These effects should be taken into account when discussing medical risks with patients.

The logarithm is an extremely powerful and useful tool for graphical data presentation. One reason is that logarithms tum ratios into differences , and for many sets of data, it is natural to think in terms of ratios.

Assume t/u = v/w

Then on a graph involving these four numbers on the original scale, it is difficult to visually detect the equality of the ratios withoutreading numerical values from the scale and doing mental arithmetic.
If we plot logarithms we have a much better chance of detecting equality, since it is now a matter of perceiving that the distance along the log scale of log (t) to log (u) is equal to the distance from log (v) to log (w); thisis a reasonable graphical perceptual chore.




Resolution

Data that are amounts or counts are often very skewed to the right; on graphs of such data, there are a few large values that take up most of the scale and the majority of the points are squashed into a small region of the scale with no resolution.


Log base 2 and log base e should always be considered.
natural logarithms have a wonderful property

Suppose t and u are positive numbers and tlv =1 + r, where r is between - .25 and .25. Then to a good approximation, log (ti v) is r . For r positive the largest error in this range is for r = .25: log (I + .25) = .223. For r negative the largest error in this range is for r = - .25: log(1 - .25) = - .287. Thus on a natural log plot, if two values-log (t) and log (u)-differ by an amount log (t) - log (u) = r that is between - .25 and .25, then we know tis approximately 100,\% larger than u if r is positive and 100,\% smaller if r is negative.


Multibased logging is important for presenting data on log scales; using base 2 or base e in place of base IO can frequently enhance understanding of the variation in the data.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents. We find that no matter how the information is presented, Canadians are united in supporting drastic confinement measures and in accepting that these measures will not be removed soon.},

We ﬁnd that participants who are prompted to reﬂect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension.

One reason why this development is important is that precision of numerical magnitude knowledge is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to both whole and rational number arithmetic. Rational number arithmetic, however, also poses challenges beyond understanding the magnitudes of the individual numbers. Some of these challenges are inherent; they are present for all learners. Other challenges are culturally contingent; they vary from country to country and classroom to classroom.

in short, the more data points, the worse the extrapolations.
extrapolation of exponential functions improves when less data points are shown. Is this improvement due to an increased sensitivity to growth or to an overall willingness to produce large numbers?

the willingness to produce large numbers, a, is affected when many data points are presented.


when predicting future points on a time series, participants underestimated amount graphed when they were presented more data. These researchers presented participants with a number of data points (ns=3, 5, or 7) and required them to specify thevalue that would be reached after another k years if the process went on uninhibited. The judgments of participants were greater (and hence more accurate) when fewer data points were presented. Wagenaar and Timmers argued that series with fewer data points impart the message that the next value should be large.

Anchoring. Segmenting a component of the image that is a standard for some estimate.
Scanning: “Sweeping” across the distance in the image being estimated.
Projection: Sending out a ray from one point in the image to another.
Superimposition: Moving elements of the image to a new location often so that the elements overlap another component of the image.
people have schemata for graphs that include slots for the conceptual message of the graph.
we demonstrated that elementary code and judgment task interact to determine performance.
we proposed elementary processes of anchoring, scanning, projection, superimposition, and detection operators to explain theseinteractions.

processes required to interpret relevant information. In Experiments 2 and 3, the researchers
isolated one important factor that affects viewers' interpretation (i.e., the perceptual
organization of the information in graphs). If relevant quantitative information is perceptually
grouped to form visual chunks (because relevant data points are either connected in line graphs

At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education.

We combine simple texture patternswith perceptually uniform colors to increasethe number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds multicolored perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in an element are used to vary the appearance of its pexel. Texture and color patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by varying three separate texture dimensions: height, density, and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision, and human visual psychophysics have identifiedthese dimensions as importantfor the formation of perceptualtexture patterns. The pexelsare colored using a selection technique that controls color distance, linear separation, and color category. Proper use of these criteria guarantees colors that are equally distinguishable from one another. We describe a set of controlled experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our texture dimensions and color selection criteria. We then discuss new work that studies how texture and color can be used simultaneously in a single display. Our results show that variations of height and density have no effect on color segmentation, but that random color patterns can interfere with texture segmentation. As the difficulty of the visual detection task increases, so too does the amount of color on texture interference increase. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our approach to a real-world problem, the tracking of typhoon conditions in Southeast Asia.},

transformation from table to graph

human information processing capabilities- the ability to recognize, classify, and remember visual patterns.


We do not know much about the perceptual, psychophysical, and cognitive processes that arc invoked during the examination of a graph.

We often rely on intuition to guide us in deciding whether a graph is good or bad, and we do not know how damaging "bad" graphs are.
because they are intended for an audience that is generally less expert than their author, presentation graphs necessarily tend to be simple in form and content


Pie Charts: Good vs Bad

For many years, the use of pie charts was frowned upon by statistical experts, based on psychophysical evidence (see Baird, 1970, for a review) that judgments of area, angle, and arc length are less accurate than judgments of length. Hence, the bar chart was favored.
A critical review of the existing evidence suggests that the prejudice against the pie chart is unfounded.
In spite of these results, modern commentators continue to advocate the bar chart in preference to the pie chart.


areas are systematically underestimated whereas line lengths are not.
Cleveland \& McGill

perceptual judgments of six basic stimuli were examined: (1) position along a common scale, (2) position along nonaligned scales, (3) length, (4) angle, (5) slope, and (6) area.


Spence (1989)

examined the speed and accuracy with which subjects judge the visual elements that make up pie charts, bar charts, and several variants, and also estimated the power function exponents for each element.
the addition of extra dimensions is not harmful, provided that base size remains constant.


Culbertson and Powers (1959)

a series of individual bars (either horizontally or vertically oriented) is superior to a line graph if specific quantities must be estimated.


Schutz (1961 b)

recommends that when several time series (in the experiment, he varied their number from two to four) are to be compared simultaneously, all variables should be shown as multiple lines in a single graph, rather than as individual lines in separate panels.


Paivio (1974)

summarizes several studies and concludes that there is at least a 10\% advantage in recall for pictures over words or sentences.
numerical information was better remembered when presented in a graph than when embedded in text.
By extension, if ways can be found to construct graphs that encourage and facilitate the formation of interacting images, memory for such graphs should be improved.


Tufte

advises maximizing the "data ink ratio"; that is, the ratio of printer's ink used for data to the ink used for other parts of the graph.
the graphs presented by Tufte as examples of good graphical practice are rather stark and minimalist. In ouropinion, people are more likely to be drawn to attractive, appealing graphs and, conversely, to be repelled by dry, sterile depictions of the data, devoid of even the slightest decoration. If a graph is not examined, it might as well not have been drawn. Moreover, we speculate that a decorated graph may be better remembered than a minimalist chart, anissue not considered by Tufte ( 1983).


Bobko and Karren (1979)

suggested that people's estimates are closer to the square of the correlation (r2) rather than to the correlation itself. Strahan



Cleveland and McGill ( 1984b)


advocate smoothing of scatterplots to assist in detecting the shape of the point cloud in situations where the error in the data is substantial, or where the density of points changes along the abscissa.



Multivariate displays are used to find clusters of related data points and to detect outlying or atypical points.

Use of Faces for symbols? Weird.

Six participants (two psychology professors, four psychology graduate students) viewed graphs on a computer screen and identified the underlying trend.

participants extrapolate data from a time series in a two-step process (Wagenaar \& Timmers,1978).

First, the properties of the time series are identified, e.g., whether the series is stationary, exhibits an increase or decrease, accelerates or decelerates.
After these properties are identified, participants use the rules they have discovered to predict future points.


discrimination is the first step in extrapolation, it is important to specify the ability of participants to discern among different functions.

Compared many factors:


exponential, asymptotic, and linear trends


increasing or decreasing


bar, suspended bar, scatter, and line plots


number of points


high, medium, low variability




Asked to identify the type of curve (exponential, asymptotic, linear; increasing, decreasing)


definition of exponential decreasing is … not what a mathematician would use. y=C+−ex instead of y=e−x. y=e−x is what they’ve defined as asymptotic decreasing.




n=6 with {\textasciitilde}2k trials per participant


hypothesis is 2-stage estimation: first, identify the type of curve and direction, then use that information for prediction


this experiment is examining whether discrimination between curve types is possible




accuracy higher when nonlinear trends presented (e.g. it’s hard to say something is linear, but easy to say that it isn’t)


accuracy higher with low variability – variability was additive, e.g. constant variance around mean function


it appears that participants examined curvature to make the determination of type


Takeaway: Use line/scatter plots


Takeaway 2: Increasing \# points helps with determination of linearity but doesn’t affect determination of nonlinearity


Takeaway 3: Accuracy ranged from 75\% to 50\% (ish) at determination of the type of curve. Any prediction errors would be on top of that.

I don’t fully understand the methods in this paper, particularly the graphical scale interlocking and rearrangement. It seems a bit insane.

Plotting exponential growth inversely reduces misperception – likely because the steepest part of the curve is shown early in the curve when participants are creating a heuristic for prediction.

Numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves
Perceptual issue: ability to discriminate between values of ββ in functions y=expβxy=exp⁡βx
Aspect ratio of the graph didn’t significantly affect misperception
Instruction on exponential growth reduces underestimation, but doesn’t change issues with consistent underestimation of ββ - correction factor is the same across all problems. That is, participants increased estimates of y=αexpβxy=αexp⁡βx by increasing αα, not by changing ββ. Accuracy was still not as good using graphs as with numerical estimation

No correlation of accuracy with mathematical credit hours found (Experiment 1)

Takeaway: Using a log scale should make it much easier to estimate ββ - we estimate slopes relatively accurately (Mosteller et al. 1981), resolving much of the difficulty with exponential estimation
Takeaway 2: Direction of error (underestimation) is the same regardless of the question type asked:

Predict for (t+5)
Predict for (t+1, t+2, …, t+5)
At what time t will y surpass (value)? (Inverse prediction) That is, in the 3rd formulation, t is consistently over-estimated (corresponding to an under-estimation of y at time t)

Context matters!!!

experimental studies usually involve highly specific tasks carried out by particular types of subjects under a particular set of conditions.
variables:

forecasting environment, type of subject, information available to subjects, presence or absence of insentives




Goal: bring together research methods and limitations with practical implications
Tasks:

No context available

judgemental extrapolation of time series pattern into future
judgemental adjustment of statistical model's extrapolation


Context available

judgemental integration of time series \& contextual info in order to produce a forecast
judgemental adjustment of the forecast of a statistical model




Discussion Points:

processes, according to research, people use when applying judgement to forecasting tasks
evidence these processes can lead to systematically biased forecasts
effectiveness of particular strategies which are designed to improve the performance of the task


Heuristics and biases in time series extrapolation

anchoring (initial value from long term mean or previous value) and adjustment (adjust from anchor to obtain final forecast) F\_t+1 = Ybar + alpha(Y\_t = Ybar) == (1-alpha)Ybar + alphaY\_t


See tables 1 - 3 for review summaries of literature
Holt's model heuristic (three of them?)
Biases

Failure to identify correctly the nature of the underlying process
Failure to extrapolate this process accurately, even if it has been correctly identified


Problems:

Noise in the series masks the true signal.
People have a poor conception of randomness.


Does space allowed on a graph matter?
Do horizontal axis labels matter?
Number of points: underlying trend is important!

Larger the difference between observations two periods apart made the growth of the series more salient.
Think of this as we notice large differences when we are gone for a while verses if you are seeing the incremental changes.


Technical knowledge offers no advantage to the forecaster

Method of combination (ensemble methods?)

Logarithms convert multiplicative relationships to additive ones, providing an elegant way to span many orders of magnitude, to show elasticities and other proportional changes, and to linearize power laws.

They also have practical purposes, easing the computation of small numbers such as likelihoods and transforming data to fit statistical assumptions.


Questions:

How often do ecologists encounter log-scaled data?
How well do ecologists understand log-scaled data?


When presenting log-scaled data, it is possible to use either untransformed values (for example, values of 1, 10 and 100 are equally spaced along the axis) or log-transformed values (for example, 0, 1, and 2).
The main part of our survey presented respondents with graphs that were randomly displayed on linear–linear scales (Fig. 2a,d and g), log–log scales with untransformed values (Fig. 2b,e and h), or log–log scales with log-transformed values (Fig. 2c,f and i).

Two relationships were shown on each graph, with distance from the edge of a habitat on the horizontal axis and population size.

whether each population was increasing or decreasing with distance
how steeply the rabbit population changed with distance compared to the chipmunk population.!!!!

Misconception: ‘hand-hold fallacy’

Climbing something steep is harder than climbing something gradual, but climbing something smooth (such as a window) is harder than climbing something with hand-holds (such as a ladder), regardless of slope.




population level at the edge of the habitat.

Misconception: ‘Zeno’s zero fallacy’

Zeno’s famous paradox states that a distance can never be reduced to zero because it must be halved infinitely many times and it is impossible to perform an infinite number of tasks.




the manner in which a population changes.

3 Misconceptions: ‘watch out for curves fallacies’

all lines in log–log space are also lines in linear–linear space
all lines in log–log space curve upwards in linear–linear space
curves in log–log space have similar curvature in linear–linear space

Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

We show that the choice of the scale adopted on these graphs has important consequences on how people understand and react to the information conveyed. In particular, we find that when we show the number of COVID-19 related deaths on a logarithmic scale, people have a less accurate understanding of how the pandemic has developed, make less accurate predictions on its evolution, and have different policy preferences than when they are exposed to a linear scale. Consequently, merely changing the scale the data is presented on can alter public policy preferences and the level of worry about the pandemic, despite the fact that people are routinely exposed to COVID-19 related information. Providing the public with information in ways they understand better can help improving the response to COVID-19, thus, mass media and policymakers communicating to the general public should always describe the evolution of the pandemic using a graph on a linear scale, at least as a default option. Our results suggest that framing matters when communicating to the public.},

	shorttitle = {Student accuracy in reading logarithmic plots},
	doi = {10.1109/FIE.2013.6684990},
	abstract = {Through extensive student testing and interviews, we found that the majority of university sophomore, junior, and senior engineering students in a standard introductory materials science engineering course have a variety of difficulties reading correct values from simple logarithmic graphs. For example, students often unknowingly interpreted the log scale as linear and were confused about the order of magnitude of a value in the negative exponent region. To address these issues, we used the results of our findings to develop and implement a set of online “essential skills” tasks to help students achieve a core level of mastery and fluency in reading log plots, a basic and critical skill for engineers. The online tasks were administered as for-credit homework assigned several times throughout the semester, and students spent 10-20 minutes on each assignment. Results of post-tests indicate that with this minimal practice, students were able to dramatically improve their accuracy in reading log plots compared to a control group with no log plot practice. Furthermore, testing one month after training demonstrated that student continued to retain the learned skill. Future development will focus on making these essentials skills task broadly available online and further improving effectiveness and usability.},
